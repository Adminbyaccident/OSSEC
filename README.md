# OSSEC
OSSEC installation and configuration scripts

## The ossec_sources_nogui_ubuntu.sh script
This script will install from sources an OSSEC server on Ubuntu 18.04

## The ossec_sources_gui_ubuntu1804.sh script
This script will install an OSSEC server from sources on an Ubuntu 18.04 system and will include a web user interface OSSEC-WUI.

Be aware this Web User Interface is deprecated and no longer maintained. Use it at your own discretion.

This script does also need improvement by now since Apache is working on port 80 and not on 443 with TLS.
